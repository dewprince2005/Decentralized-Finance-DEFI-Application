DeFi Lending Protocol - Complete Project Documentation
Project Overview
This is a comprehensive decentralized finance (DeFi) lending and borrowing protocol that allows users to supply tokens to earn interest and borrow tokens by paying interest. The protocol features dynamic interest rates based on utilization, similar to popular DeFi platforms like Aave and Compound.
üèóÔ∏è Architecture
Smart Contract Layer

Main Contract: DeFiLendingProtocol.sol - Core lending logic with dynamic interest rates
Mock Tokens: MockERC20.sol - Test tokens (USDC, WETH, WBTC) for development
Libraries: OpenZeppelin contracts for security and standards compliance

Frontend Layer

React Application: Modern, responsive web interface
Web3 Integration: Direct blockchain interaction through MetaMask
Real-time Data: Live market data and user portfolio tracking
